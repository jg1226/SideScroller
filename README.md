# SideScroller
2D java game.
main method located in game.
Most of the code came from a tutorial I merely adjusted it use stuff from Metriod a Nintendo prperty.
I added more animations and adjusted the bullet object to fire up and adjusted it to work regardless of which way the player is facing.
I also made change to block and player sizing.
Use w,a,s,d to move, Shift to jump, space bar to fire and r to reload when you can't fire anymore.
